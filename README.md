Final Project

The Executable of our project is named pathFinder.  To get information on all the
command line calls, you can read below, or run ./pathFinder through the terminal.

Random Airport Code Call:
./pathFinder list [number<5997]
    This will give a list of 100 airport 3-letter codes.  The codes you recieve
    are determined by the number (up to 5997) argument that follows "list".


Primary CommandLine Call:
./pathFinder [Type of operation (DISTANCE or STOPS)] [3-letter airport code source] [3-letter airport code destination]
